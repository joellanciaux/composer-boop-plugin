Cursor added `Composer Boop`'s original functionality natively + changed some of the tech I was using to detect composer completions. Rather than fix this add-on, you should just use the new Cursor setting.

Just enable the the "Play Sound on Finish" option and you'll get your boop when composer is ready.


# Composer Boop

A VS Code extension that plays a sound notification when you stop typing in Cursor's composer window.

## Why?

Cursor's Composer / Chat is awesome, but I found it pretty hard to keep track of long-running updates (especially in agent mode!). I made this simple extension to give some feedback when there's an "Accept Change" prompt. It's been pretty helpful for me when multitasking while Cursor does its thing.

## Caveats

This is pretty jank due to VS Code's extension security model and the lack of a way to detect when Cursor's composer is open. In lieu of this, I'm just looking at change events on the chat / composer's code blocks. It's not 100% reliable, but it gets the job done.

Hoping that Cursor adds this feature natively soon!
